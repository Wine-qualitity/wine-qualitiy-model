# Functions to use for our data 





def split(df):
    '''
    This function splits a dataframe into 
    train, validate, and test in order to explore the data and to create and validate models. 
    It takes in a dataframe and contains an integer for setting a seed for replication. 
    Test is 20% of the original dataset. The remaining 80% of the dataset is 
    divided between valiidate and train, with validate being .30*.80= 24% of 
    the original dataset, and train being .70*.80= 56% of the original dataset. 
    The function returns, train, validate and test dataframes.
